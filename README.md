# Apify base Docker images

[![Release Status](https://travis-ci.com/apify/apify-actor-docker.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/apify/apify-actor-docker/workflows/Release%20Images/badge.svg)

Public Docker images for Apify Actor serverless platform (https://docs.apify.com/actor)

The sources for the images are present in subdirectories that are named as the corresponding
Docker image. For example, the `node-basic` directory corresponds to the
[apify/actor-node-basic](https://hub.docker.com/r/apify/actor-node-basic/) Docker image.

The images are using the following tags:

Tag         | Description
----------- | -------------
`latest`    | Well-tested production version of the image.
`beta`      | Development version of the image.

## Maintenance

In order to build and publish a new version of the Docker images,
open the Actions tab and find the Release Images workflow.
You can then run the workflow by providing the following inputs:

- A tag, which will be used to tag the image in DockerHub. Typically beta or latest.
- A version of the `apify` package that should be pre-installed in the images.
- A version of the `puppeteer` package that should be pre-installed in the images that use Puppeteer.

### Adding a new actor image

To create a new image, which is not yet published in Apify DockerHub organization.
You need access to the organization and rights to create a new repository.
After, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder with the same name as the package you want to create without the prefix `actor-`. 
For image `apify/actor-node`, create folder `node`.

2. Create a source of the image in that folder. Remember to create a test that is runnable using docker run to be able to test in the image in CI/CD.

3. Create a new repository in the Apify DockerHub organization, use the name with `actor-` prefix, e.g. `apify/actor-node`.

4. Give permission Read & Write to create image for devs groups in the Apify DockerHub organization.

5. Create a GitHub workflow which builds, tests and publishes the image into the DockerHub.
